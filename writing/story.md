# Story

## Intro

You're a wizard in a company that deals in magic (many departments, including putting enchantments on things, predicting future, summoning creatures, generating energy). You have just gotten to level 3 --- an ordinary and no longer noob tier level, but nothing special. So you talk to your manager.

talk to manager about promotion, manager says you have to fight 4 bosses to be promoted.

## First boss

first boss is straightforward to get to, just battles along the way

talk to NPCs that want your help with various magical tasks (fix things, retrieve things, find things)

news stories tell you about practical implications of magic for geopolitics

make fun of mechanics teaching quests at beginning of RPGs

also need to teach you what the world is like by having casual discussions about it (plus the news)

## Second boss

second boss requires a fetch quest: evil organization has disconnected power supply, need to find a new supplier and complete a delivery

## Third boss

third boss requires going through a dungeon: just a complicated maze

need to solve some sort of puzzle (want this to be a thinly veiled SAT problem)

## Final boss

final boss is the most evil

# Overall story

all the bosses are involved in some larger plot to destroy/takeover the world

taking out the first three bosses actually slowly foils their plans, thereby saving the world --- the final boss is the leader of the whole organization and eventually the whole plan rests with him

who knows about the plot?
- none of the characters?
- everybody but the wizard?

# Questions to answer

- decide what battles play like
- decide how and when to convey story
- incorporate an RPG trope quest
- does the main character speak?
- how does the party work?
- how much is parody and how much is imitation of RPGs?

## Battles

mimicking Pokemon as much as possible:
- party grows with summons of creatures
- creatures fight on your behalf
- wild battles as well as the boss fights
- choose actions and switch between creatures - for simplicity, maybe only have one or two actions per creature

minimal viable battle system:
- boss battles are all direct head-to-head
- experience via silly grinding (like destroying grass or enchanting objects in an assembly line)
- experience gained with NPC quests
- boss battles are a magical duel (approximately analogous to Harry Potter, but more summoning going on)
  - no interactivity
  - write variants for underleveled (lose), correct level (win), overleveled (win)

## Conveying story

can have cutscenes that take the whole display between major events

can divide the info panel into several sections and rotate between them according to events: selection/dialogue, story, news

can show story on selection of specific items

## Speech

in line with Pokemon/Zelda character would not speak, despite interacting with many others

good opportunity for parody

especially makes sense if party members are just summons, as opposed to people that might have a conversation (as in Final Fantasy)

## Party

- Party should grow
- Heal at specific centers - if there's money, it should be plentiful
- can switch between party members during battle
- no reordering (reduces interface) but perhaps can switch at any time
- if members are summons, maybe more than one allowed at a time?
- need to implement a battle interface for the party to be meaningful

## Parody

- High parody makes it easier to write
- Some mechanics have to be real to some extent - quests, leveling up, talking to people
- Parody:
  - protagonist doesn't speak and NPCs don't find this weird
  - talking to same NPC multiple times and expecting same response
  - not needing to eat/rest?
  - theme is always saving the world
  - pick up skills very quickly
  - experience, leveling up as a proxy for getting better
  - constantly fighting things?
  - fetch quests
  - villain wants to somehow ruin the world
  - villain minions are highly loyal
  - magic implies ridiculous consequences of simple violations of physics
  - economics of RPG worlds never clear
  - items drop from battles
  - items found in chests everywhere
  - regeneration upon leaving an area
