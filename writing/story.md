# Story

## Intro

You're a wizard in a company that deals in magic (many departments, including putting enchantments on things, predicting future, summoning creatures, generating energy). You have just gotten to level 3 --- an ordinary and no longer noob tier level, but nothing special. So you talk to your manager.

talk to manager about promotion, manager says you have to fight 4 bosses to be promoted.

## First boss

first boss is straightforward to get to, just battles along the way

talk to NPCs that want your help with various magical tasks (fix things, retrieve things, find things)

news stories tell you about practical implications of magic for geopolitics

make fun of mechanics teaching quests at beginning of RPGs

also need to teach you what the world is like by having casual discussions about it (plus the news)

## Second boss

second boss requires a fetch quest: evil organization has disconnected power supply, need to find a new supplier and complete a delivery

## Third boss

third boss requires going through a dungeon: just a complicated maze

need to solve some sort of puzzle (want this to be a thinly veiled SAT problem)

## Final boss

final boss is the most evil

# Overall story

all the bosses are involved in some larger plot to destroy/takeover the world

taking out the first three bosses actually slowly foils their plans, thereby saving the world --- the final boss is the leader of the whole organization and eventually the whole plan rests with him

who knows about the plot?
- none of the characters?
- everybody but the wizard?

# Questions to answer

- decide what battles play like
- decide how and when to convey story
- incorporate an RPG trope quest
- does the main character speak?
- how does the party work?

## Battles

mimicking Pokemon as much as possible:
- party grows with summons of creatures
- creatures fight on your behalf
- wild battles as well as the boss fights
- choose actions and switch between creatures - for simplicity, maybe only have one or two actions per creature

minimal viable battle system:
- boss battles are all direct head-to-head
- experience via silly grinding (like destroying grass or enchanting objects in an assembly line)
- experience gained with NPC quests
