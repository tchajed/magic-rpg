<h2>{{obj.name}}</h2>

{{#eq object "player"}}
<p>This is you, the player. You are a wizard in Magical Consulting, LLC (a
Delaware company).</p>

<button id="clear-data">clear data</button>
{{else eq object "start"}}
<p>This is a starting block. It has no real-world equivalent, but it abuses
the object selection mechanism to introduce the story.</p>

<p>You are a mid-tier wizard at {main company}. The company is huge, responsible
for most of the types of magic in the world. Their work is exported all around
the world and their name is a byword for quality.</p>

<p>People used to think of wizards as wearing these silly, antiquated robes and
pointy hats. The robes invariably had little lightning bolts. It was almost as
if wizards worked in their pajamas and had eccentric taste in hats. This is far
from the reality. Magic is a consulting-based business with face-to-face client
interaction - most wizards wear business suits and are sharply dressed with
ties. The pointy hats aren't nearly so pointy and are actually a sophisticated
magic-enhancing funnel, technology created in just the last few decades.</p>

<p>ANYWAY, you're at the point where you've done a reasonable job in your
current position, rising through the ranks just in time not to be fired. You're
ready to go to the next stage, but you haven't gotten the usual email about the
magical test battle and written exam. So you check in with your manager.</p>

{{else eq object "table"}}

This is just a conference table. There's nothing on it and it isn't important.

{{else eq object "manager"}}

<blockquote>

<p>Hi, I'm your manager. I don't know why I'm telling you, since you ought to
know that by now.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>We were wondering when you would ask about that. Every employee in your stage
has only one way to move up: a series of trials, facing your superiors. Every
boss got where they are this way, and maybe you will, too!</p>

<p>You'll be given a series of challenges, each in a specific form or style or
element of magic. Each will test your skills, pushing you to be the very best
&mdash; and rewarding you if you turn out to be.</p>

</blockquote>
{{else eq object "bossA"}}
{{#unless state.talkedToManager}}
You don't know who I am! Why should I talk to you?
{{else}}
<blockquote>
<p>I'm the first boss. I guess I'd fight you or something?</p>

<p>You've trained heavily for this battle. Enough that it might even be a
fair fight. The boss eyes you as an equal. When &mdash; and if &mdash; you
emerge victorious, you can know that skill was involved.</p>
</blockquote>
{{/unless}}
{{else eq object "enemy"}}

<p>You've trained heavily for this battle. It all comes down to making the
critical move. Without stopping to look up from your phone, you dispatch the
enemy with one overpowered move. Your reward is a juicy 15 XP, which you gladly
take, knowing only 89 are left to get to the next one.</p>

{{else eq object "greeter"}}

<p>You arrive 15 minutes late to the meeting, after wandering around aimlessly,
reading books that you've walked past every day in the office. Others don't
comment on your tardiness (how polite of them). Instead they jump right in.</p>

<p>You wander around more, looking for trouble. It would almost seem like you...
wanted to fight mindless monsters? Who would do that? The creatures of the
forest oblige you, happily coming to you with their monotonous troubles.</p>

{{else eq object "bossB"}}
{{#unless state.talkedToManager}}
You don't know who I am! Why should I talk to you?
{{else}}
<blockquote>
<p>I'm the second boss. I guess I'd fight you or something?</p>

<p>You've waltzed in here looking for trouble. The boss eyes you
like you're 11 years old and thought that determination was all that
counted and not the cold hard numbers. He doesn't feel the need to go
easy on you.</p>

<p>It had all come to this. The final battle, against this boss of the {board}.
This boss was special. There was a medical facility outside his office for a
reason [well, mostly to save you some time]. As everyone but you has gathered,
he is the leader of a great evil organization, the {evil organization}, which
secretly controls the world. They have great interest in the {trade deal}
falling apart, hoping that in the resulting anarchy their clandestine operation
of illegal wand dealing would be all that people have left, funding their much
more nefarious plans for world domination and enslavement. Despite this evil,
the fight will be a fair one, and he will face you head on.</p>
