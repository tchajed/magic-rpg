    <p>Hi, we could use your help. We run a magic carpet business, but we lost
    access to all our raw materials at the same time! Maybe you could help us
    source them from the right suppliers?</p>

    <p>Great! Thanks for agreeing to help us out. We're counting on you to get
    our town's economy back on track and avoid putting lots of people out of
    work.</p>

    <p> As everyone knows, it takes thread, magical powder, and a power source to
    make a magic carpet. We have all the tools needed to assemble them here
    in-house, but we need your help sourcing the materials. Don't make the
    materials <em>too</em> expensive, or we'll be better off not making any and
    that's just what we'll do.</p>
