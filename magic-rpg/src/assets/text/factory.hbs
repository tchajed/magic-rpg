<p>It's a bridge to some unknown and no doubt interesting land.</p>

<p>
{{#eq obj.state "default"}}
Looks like a bunch of building materials and no actual bridge. Not sure what the materials are supported by.
{{else eq obj.state "halfway"}}
The bridge is halfway done! Maybe you'll be able to cross after all.
{{else eq obj.state "almost-done"}}
Almost there, but they have to finish if you want to get off on this side.
Which you do.

{{#eq state.bridgeStatus 100}}
<p>We've been hard at work, and the bridge is finally done!</p>
{{else}}
<p>We're still working on the bridge across this gap.</p>

{{#eq state.bridgeStatus 90}}
<p>It's almost done! Just wait a little longer. We just need some more time, and we'll take care of it, all on our own.</p>

    <p>Hi, we could use your help. We run a magic carpet business, but we lost
    access to all our raw materials at the same time! Maybe you could help us
    source them from the right suppliers? Come back to me if you decide you're
    up for the task.</p>
  {{else eq state.buyStatus 'explained'}}
    <p>Great! Thanks for agreeing to help us out. We're counting on you to get
    our town's economy back on track and avoid putting lots of people out of
    work.</p>

    <p> As everyone knows, it takes thread, magical powder, and a power source to
    make a magic carpet. We have all the tools needed to assemble them here
    in-house, but we need your help sourcing the materials. Don't make the
    materials <em>too</em> expensive, or we'll be better off not making any and
    that's just what we'll do.</p>

  <p>Ooh, it looks like the magic carpets are underpowered. Are you sure your
  choice of thread and power source work together?</p>
  {{else unless state.sourceConstraints.[!silk+uranium]}}
  <p>These materials are too expensive! We'd lose money buy making them, so why
  bother?</p>
  {{else unless state.sourceConstraints.[!polyester]}}
  <p>We made one and it just kind of fell apart.</p>
  {{else unless state.sourceConstraints.[lion->power]}}
  <p>The magic carpets are slightly underpowered in quality assurance tests. Can you try to get materials that get us more range?</p>
  {{else unless state.sourceConstraints.[power->silk]}}
  <p>We couldn't get the magic to stick, so they didn't really have
  <em>flight</em>, just <em>lift</em>. It works for me, but it'll never get
  past safety regulations.</p>

<p>Hello there. I'm a dealer in {{obj.props.resourceName}}. Unfortunately I
only work with business customers and can't directly sell you any of my wares.
There isn't actually enough space in the shop for all my stuff, obviously.</p>
{{else}}
  <p>Hello customer!</p>

  {{#eq object "polyester-dealer"}}
  <p>Polyester is the best! It's cheap, it's fake, it's basically a fabric!</p>
  {{else eq object "control-dealer"}}
  <p>Oh, you're using this for a flying carpet? This is the perfect type of
  powder for you, then. It increases control more than any other powder, giving
  a smooth and comfortable ride, even for inexperienced carpet users.</p>
  {{else eq object "power-dealer"}}
  <p>This is no ordinary powder: it lasts a long time, often supplementing
  less-powerful batteries in magical components.</p>
  {{else eq object "all-dealer"}}
  <p>My product is very special &mdash; it combines a magical powder with an
  all-natural energy source. The powder can be used to give things flight,
  power electronics, and even bake cake!</p>
