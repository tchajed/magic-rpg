<blockquote>

<p>Hi, I'm your manager. I don't know why I'm telling you, since you ought to
know that by now.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>We were wondering when you would ask about that. Every employee in your stage
has only one way to move up: a series of trials, facing your superiors. Every
boss got where they are this way, and maybe you will, too!</p>

<p>You'll be given a series of challenges, each in a specific form or style or
element of magic. Each will test your skills, pushing you to be the very best
&mdash; and rewarding you if you turn out to be.</p>

<p>These bosses will require intense training. You'll probably want to find some random wizards to fight with (don't worry, it's totally safe, they can always heal up).</p>

  <strong>REMINDER TO ALL OFFICE PERSONNEL</strong>
  </p>

  The administration wishes to remind all office workers that slowing down time
  during the lunch hour is not permitted. Time dilation has serious negative
  effects on the precision time spells being cast concurrently and we have
  received several customer complaints about incorrect ageing. We expect all
  employees to get their work done in normal time.

  <strong>Reminder: annual company Christmas party</strong>
  </p>

  All employees and their families are invited to the annual Christmas party, to
  be held on Hyperion! As you no doubt know, that's a moon of Saturn &mdash; see
  the attached instructions for exact teleportation coordinates. We would like
  to remind everyone to please create a protective bubble for yourself and your
  traveling companions <em>before</em> teleporting. There will be staff at the
  destination to help, but we'd rather avoid relying on that.

  1. Promotion requires exploration. Leave the building, taking the (only) exit to the
  east. Your journey will be fraught with many perils, including common folk
  that will ask for your help. We trust you will do the right thing.

{{else eq object "hint2"}}

  2. The test administered by the boss is likely to be too difficult with your
  present level of training. We recommend acquiring additional training along
  the way. Magical Consulting believes this training is best left to you to
  discover, to ensure that it reflects the real world and to keep training costs
  low.

{{else eq object "hint3"}}

  3. You will receive further instructions upon reaching {first boss}. Good luck.
