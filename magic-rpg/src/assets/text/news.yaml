  There will be nothing charming about the second-quarter earnings report from Chocobo's Shop, the biggest exporter of charmed staffs in the country. The company has faced declining sales of its once popular oaken staffs. In the last year they have rolled out a new line of bamboo-based staffs, aiming to appeal to today's more environmentally conscious young wizards.

  Malo Mart said it would cut up to 11,000 jobs across sales, marketing, and magical quality assurance by mid-2018. The world's largest peddler of mid-sized wands is facing a shift towards small, charm-sized magic and large site-wide warlock approaches, which together account for 40% of sales and have profit margins in excess of 30%. Shares declined by 4% in unenthusiastic after-hours trading.

   Calcelmo's Laboratory admitted to cheating on magic durability tests for its line of witches' brooms. Shares in Calcelmo, the world's 4th largest broom developer, plummeted by 10% today in light of the latest report from the air safety advisory panel (ASAP). The industry is still reeling from the revelation that several brooms may have been made from sub-standard fibers, which fall out quickly and leak 12 times the recommended magic emissions.

  Eight years after the breach to the dimension of beasts shook the magical protection industry to its core, regulators are cracking down on the ratings agencies that assured everyone nothing could get through the basic worldwide defense system put in place in the 80s. In theory, requiring executives to live close to rifts between portals would align incentives probably. In practice, executives at the protection agencies know best where the rifts actually are and are wont to lie about their placement.

  Expect sparks in today's monthly public magic policy meetings. Having just reduced restrictions on understandable magic incantations in the Akaneia Management Central (AMC)'s main policing efforts, the board's boss, Ludveck, is unlikely to relax policies further any time soon. He may have to respond to allegations from Ridley, head of Morthal's ultra-conservative non-magical police force, that the board's definition of understandable doesn't take into account local language, and indeed includes Latin and Elvish. The AMC's lead central wizard is unlikely to be deterred: he may well argue that magical incantations have a mostly local effect and are unlikely to affect the rest of the populace.

  Turmoil has increased the suffering of the peoples of Bloodgulch, which have been plagued by an increase in dragon summonings from the mostly black mage gang-controlled suburbs. Violence is likely to increase, as dragons don't back down once summoned. Attempts by the UN to bring in specialized dragon-control experts have been met with hostility from Bloodgulch's government, which many suspect to be run by lizards.

  The annual large business profitably survey's results are due in the next two weeks. Companies have beaten estimates, but analysts largely chock this up to low estimates due to the shortage of Chu Jelly last year. Anouki General Stores are doing well, thanks to the recent announcement of hundreds of 24-hour facilities. Large mining corporations have fared less well, with sector profits 24% below the average &mdash; prices for large diggers have declined precipitously with the recent forging of equivalent hand-held axes.

  A (non-magical) police force summit will meet today to discuss Tamriel's prison problem; namely, why are the prisons so empty? There is widespread and bipartisan agreement that teleportation has played a significant role. Expect a formal report and lots of agreements, followed by an identical level of magical arrest resistance.

  Campaigns to litter forests and dungeons with small health potions have cut adventure-related deaths by 70%. The world has much to celebrate on World Health Day. But as public-health experts will be quick to point out, this is no time for complacency. Refilling chests and caves with not only health but mana potions remains a top priority.

  30 years after a disaster struck and a portal to a world of hostile and technologically superior aliens was accidentally opened in Dibella, work continues to increase the security of large portal openings. Large portal non-proliferation has come far, but it remains all to easy to create one with the right materials. The site itself is a reminder of the dangers of inviting strangers into your dimension. The concrete encasing around the portal has begun to crack: an internationally-funded effort will swiftly replace it with a magical barrier and steel supports.

  Broom sales in Hoshido will become much more modest, given the country's ban on skimpy models to advertise merchandise. Sales numbers look to perk up this year, with the much-feared drop in demand for medium-distance travel not proving well-founded. Product continues to fly off shelves as the middle class grows. The average brooms per person are expected to exceed 2 this year. Sales of one passenger brooms are up 5.7% year-on-year.

  All eyes turn to Chet Rippo. He is alleged to have diverted $5.3 million dollars and 4300 mana from public funds for his own personal villa in the Flower Fields. He is to be tried in court, where he will certainly get off easy due to owning the entire system. Nonetheless the supreme court will use this as an excuse to try him for his poor handling of the economy. GDP has fallen 34% since he came in to power.

  Who is Samus Aran, inventor of the Grapple Beam? Today Princess Peach came forth and announced that she is in fact Samus Aran and has been going under the radar to avoid "detracting from the scientific achievement". The evidence he provided was less than satisfactory, and whether or not grapple beam cognoscenti believe him will depend on what she does next.

  Protestors stormed the walled gardens of the palace in Arcadia. They demanded change to a medieval system of patronage and cronyism, demanding replacing the long-ruling kings and queens with elected technocrats. Recalcitrant politicians from the ruling family were unmoved by the staggering level of incompetence in the government.

  Zebes' anti-magic right-wing party, Alternative for Zebes (AfD), explicitly adopted an anti-black magic stance.

  Voice farcasting network charges were capped in Termina, part of regional commission's plan to make communication more open and accessible. Local companies are now unlikely to push against the limits, instead encouraging cost-cutting innovations and competition based on price.

  Windpeak's finance watchdog ridiculed the troubled Eorzea Cafe for "a serious failure" to tighten controls on protection from copying of incantations.

  This week the Goron King, CEO of Darunia, the second-largest bomb flower mining magical support firm blamed the DoJ for blocking his $42 billion merger with the Bomb Shop, the third largest.

Now the company will be forced to pay the Bomb Shop a $5 billion break fee, cushioning their balance sheets while widening Darunia's own losses for the quarter.

  Federal prosecutors in Feymarch filed a lawsuit against the Hyrule Town Shop, demanding that it pay $4.2 billion in compensation for the collapse of a magical barrier creating an artificial dry region in the high mountain region of Kaipo.
