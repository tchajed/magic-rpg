An ordinary citizen stands in the middle of the road. They look friendly enough.

  <blockquote>
    <p>Hi, stranger! How are you? I'm fine, thanks.</p>

    <p>&hellip;</p>

    <p>Oh! Here's some helpful advice: Go right!</p>

    <p>I also found this lying around, you can have it.</p>

  <p>Hello, wizard. You work in that big office building just down the road, right? I can tell because it's the only company that still requires business casual dress in these parts any more.</p>

  <p>Did you know there's a secret hidden in the big manager's office? It looks empty but there's actually something in the floor. Look around and you might bump into it!</p>
{{else eq object "villager8"}}
  <p>A wizard, eh? We don't appreciate your kind around here. And by we I mean me in particular, and by "your kind" I mean unpromoted wizards.</p>

  <p>The last one of you that came by had a line clamoring after him looking for help with this or that, hoping for some freebies from an expert. Boy were they in for a surprise! He helped the first three with some shoddy work, as if he were just doing it for practice, and then just ran off! Can you believe that? I sure hope you'll at least try to be helpful.</p>

    <p>Hey, wizard! How's it going? Yeah, me too!</p>

    <p>Do you have a second? Could you fix this broken wheelbarrow for me?</p>

    <p>Awesome! Thanks for taking care of that for me.</p>

    <p>Oh look, it's a wizard! You have some time travel abilities, right? Could you look into the past and find my keys? I'm sure I put them down somewhere in the house but can't find them now.</p>

    <p>Oh right, of course! Thanks!</p>

    <p>Could you do me a favor, stranger? I have this letter for <strong>Darius</strong> and I need it delivered. You look like a trustworthy mail carrier, could you take care of it for me? I'd greatly appreciate it and you would be rewarded!</p>
  {{else eq state.mailDelivery "taken"}}
    <p>You still have the letter? I'm glad you haven't lost it, but please find <strong>Darius</strong> and give it to him.</p>
  {{else eq state.mailDelivery "delivered"}}
    <p>You don't have the letter! That means you must have delivered it! It's so hard for Darius and I to talk. We really appreciate you keeping us in touch.</p>

    <p>Thanks for helping us out with our mail!</p>

    <p>I heard (from someone who isn't Darius) that you talked to him and he gave you a little bonus for your efforts. Good for you!</p>

    <p>Oh when will <strong>Caroline</strong> send me that letter she owes me? If only there were a way to reach her.</p>

    <p>&hellip;</p>

    <p>Oh! Hello there, I was just talking to myself. Could you hear that? I could have sworn I didn't say anything out loud. That's pretty creepy.</p>
  {{else eq state.mailDelivery "taken"}}
    <p>&hellip;</p>

    <p>This is a most wonderous letter! You must return to <strong>Caroline</strong> and tell her I've received the letter and will write her back soon.</p>
  {{else eq state.mailDelivery "delivered"}}
    <p>I suspect you haven't actually told Caroline about the letter yet, have you? Not that I've talked to her, it's just a hunch.</p>
  {{else eq state.mailDelivery "done"}}
    <p>&hellip;</p>

    <p>Thank you for all your help.</p>
