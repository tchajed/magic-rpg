## Magic corporation

Company of wizards that do magic consulting. Only a few people have magic, but rather than creating a hierarchy it is simply privatized and commoditized.

### Gameplay

* Final Fantasy-type RPG
* Easy top-down view with movement and indoor settings
* Some battle scene as well
* Encounters are with consulting problems? Seems unsatisfying.
* Incorporate corporate meetings?
* Fight clients' problems with dialog choices specific to problem

### Specifics

  * putting charms on things
  * gathering information for people (snooping, predicting future)
  * investment company using magic to influence and predict prospects
  * source of energy
  * training people in magic (school-like)
* What brand(s) of magic are available to protagonist and in the world?
