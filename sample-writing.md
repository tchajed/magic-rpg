- {other country} will today meet with {our president}. Tensions will reign high: issues range from concerns over the magic embargo over {region} to a skirmish over creatures {other country} claims were warships sent my {our country}.
- The {region} commission on magic control will today rule in a lawsuit over an alleged abuse from {large company}. They will be found guilty and assessed a large penalty of 20 million mana (5% of annual output) to be paid over the next 5 years.
- There will be nothing charming about the second-quarter earnings report from {company}, the biggest exporter of charmed staffs in the country. The company has faced declining sales of its once popular oaken staffs. In the last year they have rolled out a new line of bamboo-based staffs, aiming to appeal to today's more environmentally conscious young wizards.
- {large company} said it would cut up to 11,000 jobs across sales, marketing, and magical quality assurance by mid-2018. The world's largest peddler of mid-sized wands is facing a shift towards small, charm-sized magic and large site-wide warlock approaches, which together account for 40% of sales and have profit margins in excess of 30%. Shares declined by 4% in unenthusiastic after-hours trading.
- {company} admitted to cheating on magika durability tests for its line of witches' brooms. Shares in {company}, the world's 4th largest broom developer, plummeted by 10% today in light of the latest report from the air safety advisory panel (ASAP).

- Eight years after the breach to the dimension of beasts shook the magical protection industry to its core, regulators are cracking down on the ratings agencies that assured everyone nothing could get through the basic worldwide defense system put in place in the 80s.

In practice, executives at the protection agencies know best where the rifts actually are and are wont to lie about their placement.
- Expect sparks in today's monthly public magic policy meetings. Having just reduced restrictions on understandable magic incantations in the {~= ECB}'s main policing efforts, the board's boss, {name}, is unlikely to relax policies further any time soon. He may have to respond to allegations from {name}, head of {country's} ultra-conservative non-magical police force, that the board's definition of understandable doesn't take into account local language, and indeed includes Latin and Elvish. The {~= ECB}'s lead central wizard is unlikely to be deterred: he may well argue that magical incantations have a mostly local effect and are unlikely to affect the rest of the populace.
- Turmoil has increased the suffering of the peoples of {small country}, which have been plagued by an increase in dragon summonings from the mostly black mage gang-controlled suburbs. Violence is likely to increase, as dragons don't back down once summoned. Attempts by the UN to bring in specialized dragon-control experts have been met with hostility from the {country}'s government, which many suspect to be run by lizards.

## Story

You are a mid-tier wizard at {main company}. The company is huge, responsible for most of the types of magic in the world. Their work is exported all around the world and their name is a byword for quality.

People used to think of wizards as wearing these silly, antiquated robes and pointy hats. The robes invariably had little lightning bolts. It was almost as if wizards worked in their pajamas and had eccentric taste in hats. This is far from the reality. Magic is a consulting-based business with face-to-face client interaction - most wizards wear business suits and are sharply dressed with ties. The pointy hats aren't nearly so pointy and are actually a sophisticated magic-enhancing funnel, technology created in just the last few decades.

Anyway you're at the point where you've done a reasonable job in your current position, rising through the ranks just in time not to be fired. You're ready to go to the next stage, but you haven't gotten the usual email about the magical test battle and written exam. So you check in with your boss.

> Ah, we were wondering when you would ask. Every employee in your stage has only one way to move up: a series of trials, much like those you're used to, but organized in a series of rounds with the other candidates. A tournament, if you will [chuckle]. The next one starts with the first round next week, so you should get ready.
>
> You'll be given a series of challenges, each in a specific form or style or element of magic. Each will test your skills, pushing you to be the very best - and rewarding you if you turn out to be.

So now begins the first stage.

[go through first gym leader]

[other gym leaders, final boss]

It had all come to this. The final battle, against this boss of the {board}. This boss was special. There was a medical facility outside his office for a reason [well, mostly to save you some time]. As everyone but you has gathered, he is the leader of a great evil organization, the {evil organization}, which secretly controls the world. They have great interest in the {trade deal} falling apart, hoping that in the resulting anarchy their clandestine operation of illegal wand dealing would be all that people have left, funding their much more nefarious plans for world domination and enslavement. Despite this evil, the fight will be a fair one, and he will face you head on.

## Player actions

You arrive 15 minutes late to the meeting, after wandering around aimlessly, reading books that you've walked past every day in the office. Others don't comment on your tardiness (how polite of them). Instead they jump right in.

You wander around more, looking for trouble. It would almost seem like you... wanted to fight mindless monsters? Who would do that? The creatures of the forest oblige you, happily coming to you with their monotonous troubles.

## Battle

You've trained heavily for this battle. It all comes down to making the critical move. Without lifting a brain muscle, you dispatch the enemy with one overpowered move. Your reward is a juicy 15XP, which you gladly take, knowing only 89 are left to get to the next one.

You've trained heavily for this battle. Enough that it might even be a fair fight. The leader eyes you as an equal. When --- and if --- you emerge victorious, you can know that skill was involved.

You've waltzed in here looking for trouble. The gym leader eyes you like you're 11 years old and thought that determination was all that counted and not the cold hard numbers. He doesn't feel the need to go easy on you.
